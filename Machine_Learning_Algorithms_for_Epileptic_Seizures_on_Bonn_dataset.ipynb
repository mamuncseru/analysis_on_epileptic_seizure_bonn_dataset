        "The goal of this research is to use various machine learning algorithms to diagnose epileptic seizures. The frequency components of the EEG are extracted for this purpose using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and parametric approaches based on the autoregressive (AR) model. Both of these methods are used as input to machine learning classification algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayesian, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Principal Component Analysis. According to test processing of both DWT and AR as feature extraction for recognition of epileptic episodes in EEG, the results reveal that k-NN, ANN, and SVM were the most efficient methods."

        "Epilepsy is a serious brain condition that is a worldwide neurological disorder. It is a clinical outcome of aberrant neurological electrical discharge of the brain. The most common positive signs and symptoms of a brain abnormality are epileptic seizures, and epilepsy is one of the most prevalent primary brain illnesses. The most common causes of epilepsy are vascular reasons, traumatic causes, infections and brain tumors, dietary deficiencies, pyridoxine deficiency, and calcium metabolism abnormalities. For improved understanding of the mechanisms generating epileptic diseases, study is required in order to diagnose epilepsy. The electroencephalogram [EEG] is used to diagnose and treat neurophysiologic diseases. The EEG is critical for accurately classifying different types of epilepsy.\n"

Because the wavelete transform method changes large low-frequency, high-frequency that is narrow for the window size. So, the entire frequency range can be achieved in the optimum time-frequency resolution.\n",

For this reason, discrete wavelete transform is used more often thanthses non-stationary signals. Wavelet scaleis divided into a number of points for x[n] process as seen in Fig.2 that is called multi-resolution decomposition. it is important that is selected appropriate wavelete decomposition level, the number of detection and wavelete transform analysis of signals. Because of classification accuracy is dependent on type of wavelet, dominant frequency components of signals are determined according to the number of decomposition levels. Wavelete coefficients contrain important information about EEG signal that provide extraction of feature vector. Statistical-time frequency of EEG signals sequences are:\n",
